# leaflet-challenge
## Description of the Project
For this challenge, I was responsible for building a webpage that displayed a world map with circle markers indicating instances where earthquakes were recorded over the previous week. The size of the circles are determined by the intensity of the earthquake and the color is determined by its depth. The goal of this map is to provide an easy to read visualization to educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing the planet.
